# My first repo

This is the first repo on GitHub, it has all the knowledge acquired during my time as QA Analyst while I was studying the [course](https://platzi.com/cursos/git-github/ "course") at [Platzi](http://www.platzi.com "Platzi"), I'm really glad to have finish it, now, I do understand many things and specially so much terms that developers normally use, my goal is to become one someday soon. 

## Welcome!
